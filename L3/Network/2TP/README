make to build binary
To test my work :
./serveur_udp.exe
./client_udp.exe localhost in another terminal
"write what you want..."

ctrl+D to stop client
ctrl+C to stop server

same for tcp, just replace serveur_udp by serveur_tcp and client_udp by client_tcp

make clean to clean object files
make fclean to clean object files and binary
